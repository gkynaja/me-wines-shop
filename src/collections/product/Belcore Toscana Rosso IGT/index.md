Intense purple colour. The olfactory profile is dominated by
Sangiovese aromas, such as violet, but it is sweetened
by the presence of Merlot tones such as blackberry and
black cherry. In the mouth, the wine is fruity with notes
of ripe blackberry. The Sangioveseâ€™s tannin is moderated by
the softness of Merlot. The long finish leaves
the palate dry and tasty.
